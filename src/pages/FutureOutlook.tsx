            <p className="mb-6">
              NeuralArc envisions a future where enterprises leverage neural architectures across all critical functions, creating organizations that learn, adapt, and evolve more rapidly than traditionally possible. We refer to this as "The Neural Enterprise" â€” a company whose competitive intelligence, decision-making, and operational processes are enhanced and accelerated by purpose-built neural networks.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-10">
              While general artificial intelligence has made significant advances, the enterprise space requires specialized neural architectures designed explicitly for business contexts. NeuralArc's mission is to build these purpose-built neural layers that integrate with existing enterprise systems while delivering transformative capabilities beyond what general-purpose AI can provide.
