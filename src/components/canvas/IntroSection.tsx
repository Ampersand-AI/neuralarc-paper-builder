            Artificial Intelligence has become one of the fastest-growing technology sectors globally, 
            with the market projected to soar from roughly $750 billion in 2025 to over $3.68 trillion by 2034.
            This explosive growth is fueled by advancements in neural networks, data analytics, and enterprise AI adoption.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            Yet, a significant portion of AI's benefits have historically been captured by large enterprises 
            with the resources to implement complex AI systems. Small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are 
            only beginning to tap into AI, despite clear evidence of its value â€“ 91% of SMBs using AI report 
            increased revenue.
