              Competitive Intelligence (CI) tools enable companies to track competitor activities 
              and market trends to inform strategy. It's a niche but growing segment â€“ valued at 
              only ~$495 million in 2025 and expected to reach $1.12 billion by 2032 (12.4% CAGR) 
              for dedicated CI software.

              NeuralArc's ORB platform introduces predictive competitive intelligence powered by 
              a neural network architecture. Instead of a "rearview mirror" on competitors, ORB 
              constructs a multi-dimensional model to forecast where competitors are heading.
